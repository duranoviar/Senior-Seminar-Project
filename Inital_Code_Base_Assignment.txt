Initial Code Base Documentation

Since I feel like I have a pretty solid code base that consists entirely of my own code,
I have elected not to include any other code snippets. I hope this is okay. 

Relevance to project: All code found in this repo is code that I wrote and is the implementation of my project so far.

Main.py - contains the main game logic. Run this to paly the game
Objects.py - contains class objects I created for use in main.py
globals.py - contains definitions I use in main.py

Note: This is just the initial code base and it will require additional features and refactoring. 
Example Code Referenced: I have referenced many different tutorials that I have documented in my bibliography 
                         and thus chose not to include them here as they are (1) easily accessable from bibliography
                         and (2) I think my initial code base is sufficient for the perceived purpose of this assignment.
